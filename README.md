# Token
The project is about deploying smart contracts using solidity language

Description

This project is about the token generation of smart contracts in solidity language. This project was initiated with "// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT" which explains the MIT license, and then the contract started with the solidity version 0.8.18. The name of the contract is "MyToken" and then started writing the code. First, the token details should initiated using variables as the token name "Phoenix", token abbreviation as "PHA" and initial supply as a 0 which explains the total supply of the contract, and then mapping the variable as balances which is used to track the token balances of address. The mint and burn functions are used to increase and decrease the supply of the token's corresponding address. This is represented as "_value".The mint function is used to mint the tokens in the corresponding address and the burn function is to reduce the tokens in the corresponding address.

Getting Started

Executing the contract

REMIX IDE is a powerful toolset for developing, deploying, debugging, and testing Ethereum and EVM-compatible smart contracts.Remix IDE provides a user-friendly interface that simplifies the Solidity development process, making it accessible to developers of all skill levels. One of the key advantages of Remix is that it offers an out-of-the-box-ready solution for decentralized app development.
